///
/// This contract allows users to stake $LUNES (native token) and earn rewards.
/// It also provides governance features for project listing proposals.
///
/// ## Key Features:
/// - Stake $LUNES tokens and earn rewards
/// - Unstake with optional penalty periods
/// - Governance voting for project listings
/// - Reward distribution based on staking duration and amount
/// - Anti-whale mechanisms for fair distribution
///
/// ## Security Features:
/// - Reentrancy protection
/// - Access control for admin functions
/// - Input validation and overflow protection
/// - Deadline-based operations
/// - Slashing protection for malicious behavior
